                                  Open library.


    At you the rare chance has appeared  to take part in the joint project  on
creation of library for the SPHINX  C-- compiler. You see dragon has  noticed,
that one  head is  good, and  it is  a little  bit better.  The future library
will form for use by the SPHINX C-- compiler v0.236.4+ .

    The future library  to me is  seen such: in  files with the  *.h extension
there will be procedures conterminous on a title, source and exit pupils  and,
certainly, is functional  with procedures standard  TC. In files  with the *.h
extension -  will there  is specific  for C--  a procedure.  In files with the
*.hmm extension  will be  common for  two previous  groups of  a procedure and
identifiers. It should  be brick, of  which other, more  high-power procedures
will be  under construction.  For procedures  in all  three groups  there is a
common request - they  should not desroy contents  of the registers (E)BP,  DS
and the flag of a direction DF for want of withdrawal from a procedure  should
be  dropped.  For  procedures  compatible  with  procedures  TC the identifier
__safe_reg_mode__  will  be  entered,  and  if  it  will  be  determined,  the
procedure will be obliged  to save all registers.  Still, not bad to  have and
32-bit variants of these procedures.

    At  the  first  stage  is  solved  to  attend to development of procedures
compatible  with  TC.  Incidentally  with  files  with extensions *.h, at this
stage, there will be also files with extensions *.hmm and *.h--.

    Your sharing can consist of this project that you can:

1 - To attend to testing of available procedures.

2 - To offer perfect variants of available procedures.

3 - In the file work_map.txt there is a list of files *.h, which are  supposed
    to be  created, and  is marked,  who in  the given  moment attends to this
    file. You can select free, file, which has liked you, and to inform on  it
    me. Then you  can begin development  of procedures included  in this file.
    If,  for  any  reasons,  you  can  not continue development of procedures,
    necessarily inform on it me, that your work could be continued by other.

4 - To send separate procedures compatible with procedures TC.

    If the realization of any procedure,  will call at you difficulty, do  not
despair, pass it and attend to other procedures. Probably, for realization  of
this procedure in the compiler still there are no conditions, and a bit  later
(you see the compiler  too will be improved)  you can again to  it return. And
can, this procedure will be realized by the more experienced fans C--.

    I do not promise, that everything,  that you will send, will be  necessary
included  in  final  library  and  just  in  that  kind,  as you offer. But is
doubtless, that your sharing will  help to create better and  rigorous library
for  the  SPHINX  C--  compiler.  The  offers,  notes  and  ready  variants of
procedures  you  can  send  on  addresses:  E-Mail:  sheker@mail.ru  or  FIDO:
2:5021/3.111.

    As this library soon will be ready, depends on you. To one to me,  without
your  help,  it  is  necessary  very  longly  to  be  carried. I wait for your
concrete offers and ready procedures.
